Let customers upload files to your WooCommerce products. Perfect for online photo or document processing services. Developer friendly.

== Description ==

Let customers upload files to your WooCommerce products. Perfect for online or document processing printing services, and it is developer friendly, with a couple key hook, which enable you to customize the plugin to your further liking.

Our plugin focuses on uploading files on the products page, for online services such as printing photos and/or documents, creating canvases, translating documents, limited only by your imagination.

All uploads for a product are centralized on product page. This enables customers to add/edit/delete files on products page, not needing to got to cart to delete file and then going back to product to add a new file, or edit.

As most website owners will only need some of the basic functionality, we thought of upping the stakes and adding some `premium` feel to our plugin, by providing a beautiful layout, with drag and drop support, a couple of hooks to change the default functionality of the plugin, overall adding that little oomph to your website.
